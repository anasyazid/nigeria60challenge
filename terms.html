        <h6 class="mt-4"><strong>5.0 Cookies</strong></h6>
        <p>Cookies are small files placed on your computer’s hard drive that enables the website to identify your
          computer as you view different pages. Cookies allow websites and applications to store your preferences in
          order to present contents, options or functions that are specific to you. Like most interactive websites, our
          website uses cookies to enable the tracking of your activity for the duration of a session. Our website uses
          only encrypted session cookies which are erased either after a predefined timeout period or once the user logs
          out of the platform and closes the browser. Session cookies do not collect information from the user’s
          computer. They will typically store information in the form of a session identification that does not
          personally identify the user.</p>
        <h6 class="mt-2"><strong>6.0 How we protect your personal information</strong></h6>
        <p>We store and process your personal information on our computers in Nigeria. Where we need to transfer your
          data to another country, such country must have an adequate data protection law. We will seek your consent
          where we need to send your data to a country without an adequate data protection law. We protect your
          information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss,
          misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data
          encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>
        <h6 class="mt-2"><strong> </strong><strong>7.0 How We Share your information within NITDA and other
            users</strong></h6>
        <p>During your interaction with our website or premises, we may provide other Ministries, Departments, Agencies
          (MDA), other organs of government, private sector operators performing government functions, with information
          such as your name, contact details, or other details you provide us for the purpose of performing our
          statutory mandate to you or third parties.</p>
        <p>We work with third parties, especially government agencies to perform NITDA services and implement its
          mandate. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or
          mobile phone number.</p>
        <p>You accept that your pictures and testimonials on all social media platforms about NITDA can be used for
          limited promotional purposes by us. This does not include your trademark or copyrighted materials.</p>

          mandated notices and essential information to aid the implementation of our mandate. We may also share your
          personal information in compliance with National or international laws; crime prevention and risk management
          agencies and service providers.</p>
        <h6 class="mt-2"><strong>8.0 Security</strong></h6>
        <p>We will always hold your information securely. To prevent unauthorized access to your information, we have
          implemented strong controls and security safeguards at the technical and operational levels. This site uses
          Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to ensure secure transmission of your personal data.
          You should see the padlock symbol in your URL address bar once you are successfully logged into the platform.
          The URL address will also start with https:// depicting a secure webpage. SSL applies encryption between two
          points such as your PC and the connecting server. Any data transmitted during the session will be encrypted
          before transmission and decrypted at the receiving end. This is to ensure that data cannot be read during
          transmission.</p>
        <p>NITDA has also taken measures to comply with global Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) we
          therefore have put in place digital and physical security measures to limit or eliminate possibilities of data
          privacy breach incidents.</p>
        <h6 class="mt-2"><strong>9.0 Data Confidentiality Rights</strong></h6>
        <p>Your information is regarded as confidential and will not be divulged to any third party except under legal
          and/or regulatory conditions. You have the right to request sight of, and copies of any and all information we
          keep on you, if such requests are made in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act and other relevant
          enactments. While NITDA is responsible for safeguarding the information entrusted to us, your role in

          measures such as non-sharing of passwords and other platform login details, adherence with physical security
          protocols on our premises, dealing with only authorized officers of the Agency.</p>
